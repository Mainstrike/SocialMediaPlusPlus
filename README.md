## Welcome to GitHub Pages

## This plugin is made by TheCyberCode (Mainstrike)
SocialMedia++ is made so server owners can make it easier for their players on their server or network to access links to relevant sites or social media and with a nice layout. The GUI also makes accessing the links more efficient which will save time when looking for commands in this plugin. SocialMedia++ is also to tell players when a YouTuber or streamer is recording or streaming and to also help people know about the stream and join in with what the YouTuber is doing...

### Permissions

SocialMedia.YouTube.Record
SocialMedia.Youtube.Stream


### Commands 
/yt - Brings up a list of commands including addchannel to player data file and more...​

[The plugin stops you doing certain commands if you have not used the command to add your channel first...]

The /yt addchannel command is accessible by anyone but it will not let them do /yt record etc unless they have the relevant permissions.​

### Installation:
Just Download the plugin and put it in your plugins folder and you can customise some parts of it within the config.yml, I advise you not to touch the player data folder unless you know what you are doing...
